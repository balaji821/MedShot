The present study assessed the role of larvicidal activities of methanolic 
leaf and inflorescence extract of Anisomeles malabarica (L.) against malarial vector 
Anopheles stephensi Liston (Insecta: Diptera : Culicidae). The larvicidal activity was 
assayed against the mosquito species at various concentrations ranging from (20 to 100 ppm) under the laboratory conditions.
