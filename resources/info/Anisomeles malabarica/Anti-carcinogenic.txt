Carcinogens are involved in carcinogenesis,  mutagenesis  and  genotoxicity. One  of  the  best  ways  to  minimize  the detrimental  effects of  carcinogens  is by  the  use of medicinal  plants i.e.,  natural anticarcinogens. These include  flavonoids, phenolics,  coumarins,  carotenoids,    anthraquinones,    tannins,  saponins    etc.  These    natural    products    play  important    role,    not    simply    in    the    primary prevention  of  cancer,  but  also in  the  prevention of  cancer  recurrence.
