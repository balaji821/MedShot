There are two types of holy basil that we get very commonly. One is the green one and the other one is slightly darker. We call the darker one “Krishna tulsi” in Tamil. It grows very commonly everywhere in our place. We use it extensively for home remedies, especially cold related conditions.

The green tulsi is very commonly found than the darker tulsi but it slightly spicy, when you taste it than the darker one. So we always use the Krishna Tulsi (black tulsi) for kids when they get cold and the greener one for adults. When my son was younger, whenever he had a cold, I used to make this Krishna Tulsi cough syrup and give it to him every day morning for three days, as per my grandmas instructions.

When you are making this cough syrup, be careful about the amount of pepper you use, especially if you are using the green tulsi. If you use a lot of pepper it will turn very spicy and one will not be able to drink it. Usually the children cry and refuse to drink it, especially if it is made with green tulsi. So try to use Krishna Tulsi for kids, especially babies. They really feel better soon, as tulsi and pepper helps to remove the phlegm very effectively.
