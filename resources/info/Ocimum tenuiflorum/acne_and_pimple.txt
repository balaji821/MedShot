Holy basil face pack is very good for treating acne and I like to combine it with turmeric for treating acne. Turmeric and tulsi are a magic combination for acne and treats acne very quickly. Along with this mask, if you consume turmeric internally it will give good relief very soon. To make the mask, first make a turmeric paste by rubbing turmeric on a coarse stone till you have enough paste.

Take fresh tulsi leaves and grind it into a fine paste using boiled water in a mortar and pestle till you get a smooth paste. Add the turmeric paste to it and mix well to a smooth paste. To use, apply a thin coating of this mixture on the face, wait for 10 to 15 minutes before washing off. Continue using it for few days regularly. Regular use of this paste also reduces the scars left by acne.
