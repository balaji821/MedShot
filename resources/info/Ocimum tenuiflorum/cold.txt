This tulsi soup is the only solution for the kids, who are adamant about not drinking tulsi kashayam, when they catch a cold. I think it is all in the name, say it’s a soup and serve it in a nice soup bowl, there is a good chance that they will drink it. But don’t get me wrong, this soup tastes really delicious and is very comforting to drink on a cold winter day.

The soup smells of ghee & pepper, with a slight smell of tulsi. Because we don’t grind the leaves, there is no bitterness nor the overpowering smell of tulsi. I have used fresh green tulsi leaves for this soup recipe. If you like, you can substitute black tulsi leaves (Krishna Tulsi) in this soup. But I really like the spiciness of the green tulsi leaves in this soup.

Anytime you are unwell, have a cold, just try this soup. It is very easy to prepare. All you need is fresh tulsi leaves and boiled toor dal water (you can save a bit of boiled dal water whenever you make rasam at home) and you have a heart warming soup.
