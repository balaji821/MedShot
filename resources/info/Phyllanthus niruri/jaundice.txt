Traditionally keelanelli has been used for treating hepatitis B. Hepatitis B caused by the infection of hepatitis B virus can lead to liver damage and hyperbilirubinemia (excess of bilirubin the blood) which in turn leads to jaundice (skin and eyes take on a yellow tinge and urine also takes on yellow color).

In our village, for treating jaundice, we grind the keezhanelli root in buttermilk and give to the patient for 48 days.
