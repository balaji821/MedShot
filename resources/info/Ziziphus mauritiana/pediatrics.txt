Jujube fruits have wonderful anti microbial properties and has been clinically proven to help prevent infections in children. It is especially useful in children who are under going chemotherapy, as they have very low immunity who are under going chemotherapy and are susceptible to infections.

It amazed me how a simple unassuming fruit can save so many young innocent children who are already going through very difficult time with cancer treatments from falling ill.
