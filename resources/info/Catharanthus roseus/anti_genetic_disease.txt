It is a nutrient that helps protect your cells from harmful "free radicals." Vitamin E also helps your body fight germs and keeps your blood vessels open and clear of clots. You may also hear it called a fat-soluble vitamin, which means it needs fat to dissolve in your body.
Most people do get enough vitamin E in their diet for good health. If your levels are low, it's likely because it's harder for your body to absorb the vitamin or the fat it needs to process it. This may be due to genetic problems or diseases like Crohn's or cystic fibrosis.
 If you have a condition that hampers your vitamin E levels, your doctor would focus first on treating that underlying cause.
