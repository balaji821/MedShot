In Mexico, folk medicine applications of prickly poppy included both external and internal remedies. 
It is listed as a purgative, and as a treatment for chest pains and asthma, and as a curative for bad blood, 
fading liver, fevers, and bad breath. External applications include treatment of poisonous bites and sore eyes. 
It is quite a laundry list of uses, and one that I would approach carefully, given the propensity of argemone oil 
to cause edema and even congestive heart failure.
