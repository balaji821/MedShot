Certain eye conditions, such as opthalmia, which is the inflammation of the eyes, and opacity of the cornea, may be treated by the juice extracted from Mexican poppy seeds. The Mexican Indians are among the ones who commonly use the juice of the plant to treat cataracts and corneal opacities. One of the ways to use the plant in order to improve your eyesight would be to soak the flower overnight and using that water to clean your eyes. The same technique may be used to treat poisonous bites from scorpion or snake. Before employing this technique, however, it is important to consult your ophthalmologist.
