Since the plant contains antibacterial properties, it is no wonder that it can prevent gum problems as well. Most gum problems take root from the bacteria that occupy the mouth, and since there are billions and billions of germs inside the mouth, it helps to have a solution that can wash them away. There is a dry powder made from the plant that may be used to brush the teeth. If you have cavities and/or toothache, then this can also be used as a relief from such pain. Before any serious oral conditions may develop due to bacteria, it is best to have a prevention in mind.
