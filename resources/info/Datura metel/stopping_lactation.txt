This poultice is a very popular remedy for stopping lactation in feeding mothers and easing the pain. When a mother stops breastfeeding when the child is old enough (usually when the child is around 1.5 to 2 years) she will experience intense pain in the breasts for a few days and the breast will be swollen and hard. Some women will develop a fever because of the intense pain. The best way to stop breast feeding with less pain is to stop the process gradually.

If you are feeding 2 times, reduce it to once and then alternate days and then slowly stop. But still some women will still experience pain, if so apply this warm compress with datura leaves on the breasts daily for a few days and slowly the pain will stop. This poultice can be used for treating boils too.

1. Collect the largest leaves of datura that you can find. Wash and pat dry to remove all the moisture.
2. Warm few drops of unrefined sesame oil in a pan. Place a leaf on top of the oil and warm it for few seconds and remove it. If you over fry the leaves, the leaves will not be supple and you will have difficulty applying it.
4. Place the warm leaf over the breasts. You can use this poultice for boils too and they will mature fast.
5. Take a thick towel and dip it in hot water, squeeze the water completely and place it over the leaf to retain the heat. Remove once it cools down.

Try applying the leaf compress 2 to 3 times per day till the pain and discomfort stops.
After you have decided to stop feeding, don’t start feeding the child again because of the pain, the pain will go in a few days. No matter when you stop you will have to go through with it. Especially after applying the datura leaves never start feeding the child again.
For treating boils, follow the same procedure…
If you have small children in the house make sure they don’t accidentally bite or swallow the leaves or flowers. It can be fatal….
