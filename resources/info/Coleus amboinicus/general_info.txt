Karpuravalli also called Indian Borage in English and Karpooravalli, Omavalli, Doddapatre and Panikoorka in other Indian languages is a very important herb that has wonderful medicinal uses and health benefits. Karpuravalli is traditionally used for treating cold and cough in infants, babies and adults.

It is also used for treating hair problems like grey hair and dandruff, aiding weight loss, for promoting hair growth and also for treating asthma and fever. Here at home, we make karpuravalli rasam and chutney with the leaves for treating cold and cough. Along with karpooravalli rasam and chutney, karpooravalli pachadi also called doddapatre tambuli in Kannada is also quite famous.
