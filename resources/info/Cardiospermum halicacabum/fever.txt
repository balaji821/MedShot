Mudakathan keerai has fever reducing properties too. It is also one of the best remedies for reducing malaria fever. If you are suffering from fever, cold and headache, try having a cup of warm mudakathan keerai soup (I have given the soup recipe below), it will greatly help reduce the fever and pain.
