It is a beautiful blue coloured flower that grows in a creeper. You will find this plant in many Indian homes as it is used in poojas and prayers. It also grows wildly and needs little maintenance, the butterfly pea plant in the above picture was growing wildly in our farm.

This beautiful creeper has wonderful medicinal uses and especially it’s use in enhancing the memory and reducing stress is very popular. Scientific studies have been done extensively on this amazing plant and many of it’s traditional uses have been proven. All parts of the plant including the leaves, seeds, roots and flowers have medicinal properties.

The root extract acts as a mild sedative and calms down the central nervous system so it can be used as an anti depressant and anti stress medicine. Many confuse Clitoria ternatea with shankhpushpi even I did at first but the true shankhpushpi is Convolvulus pluricaulis.
