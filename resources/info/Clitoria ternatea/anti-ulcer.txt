This tea has a soothing effect on our stomach and helps treat stomach ulcers. The whole plant extract has been used for treating ulcers traditionally but the tea made with the flowers also has anti ulcer properties.

This is due to presence of flavonoids in the flowers. If you are suffering from stomach ulcer, I would suggest taking this tea without adding any lemon juice.
