Inflammation is your bodyâ€™s way of healing itself and fighting infections.

However, chronic inflammation can inflict significant harm .

Stinging nettle harbors a variety of compounds that may reduce inflammation.

In animal and test-tube studies, stinging nettle reduced levels of multiple inflammatory hormones by interfering with their production.

In human studies, applying a stinging nettle cream or consuming stinging nettle products appears to relieve inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis.

For instance, in one 27-person study, applying a stinging nettle cream onto arthritis-affected areas significantly reduced pain, compared to a placebo treatment .
n another study, taking a supplement that contained stinging nettle extract significantly reduced arthritis pain. Additionally, participants felt they could reduce their dose of anti-inflammatory pain relievers because of this capsule .

That said, research is insufficient to recommend stinging nettle as an anti-inflammatory treatment. More human studies are needed.
