Both human and animal studies link stinging nettle to lower blood sugar levels .

In fact, this plant contains compounds that may mimic the effects of insulin .

In a three-month study in 46 people, taking 500 mg of stinging nettle extract three times daily significantly lowered blood sugar levels compared to a placebo.

Despite promising findings, there are still far too few human studies on stinging nettle and blood sugar control. More research is necessary.
